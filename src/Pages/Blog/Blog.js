                <h4>2.What is JWT, and how does it work?</h4>
                <p><strong>Ans:</strong>
                JSON Web Token (JWT, pronounced, same as the word "jot") is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. <br />
                In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned and must be saved locally (typically in local or session storage, but cookies can also be used), instead of the traditional approach of creating a session in the server and returning a cookie. For unattended processes the client may also authenticate directly by generating.

                <h4>4.How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?</h4>

                <p><strong>ANS:</strong> NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.</p>
